Diabetic Retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, caused by high blood sugar levels which results in damage to the back of the eye or the retina. Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the working age population of the world. An estimated 93 million people are affected by this disease. As per the NHS, an estimated 1280 new cases of diabetic retinopathy are recorded each year in England alone. Currently, the methods employed for the detection of diabetic retinopathy are manual and time consuming. The manual method involves a trained clinician evaluating retina fundus images. Although this method is effective, this process is time consuming and delays can be caused due to late submission of retina fundus images, miscommunication resulting in delayed treatment of the patients. Also, the lack of expertise and employing this method in highly populated areas is another major problem with this approach. This approach proposes a deep learning based approach
